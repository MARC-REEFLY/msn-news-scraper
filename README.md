# msn-news-scraper
A python library that scrapes news articles from MSN

The traditional python html based web scrapers (lxml) don't work because of the dynamic way that MSN News loads their pages. Selenium still does the trick but it's suuuuuuuper slow. That's why I created this library. It uses the common API patterns for MSN news and works to scrape their news pages for data.
